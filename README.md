# Broken Name Tags
Broken Name Tags drop when a pet or an entity with a custom name dies. These nametags are meant to be a memento of your fallen friend. They include the name of the animal and the death message.

Broken Name Tags can be repaired by surrounding them with string in a crafting table.
